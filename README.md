# TSLA-Historical-Data-Analysis-with-Julius-AI 

I recently performed a comprehensive analysis of Tesla’s (TSLA) historical stock data using Python and Julius AI, combining data analysis, financial metrics, and AI-driven insights. Here’s a breakdown of what I did and how:

What I Did:

Imported and cleaned stock data: Loaded daily TSLA data from CSV files, handled missing values, and standardized date/time formats.

Explored trends and patterns: Calculated and visualized 20, 50, and 200-day simple moving averages to identify momentum and trend changes.

Analyzed trading volume: Plotted daily trading volume to detect periods of unusual market activity.

Assessed risk and volatility: Examined the distribution of daily returns, calculated volatility metrics, and analyzed potential risk exposure.

Summarized historical performance: Evaluated TSLA’s 2022 performance (annual return: -4.1%, annualized volatility: 66.3%, max drawdown: -36.3%) and identified key periods of growth.

Detected significant trends: Found Tesla’s strongest 6-month uptrend, with +511.5% growth from March to September 2020.

How I Did It:

Leveraged Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib/seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Applied statistical analysis to calculate returns, volatility, and drawdowns.

Utilized Julius AI for automated data parsing, trend detection, and AI-powered exploratory insights.

Combined visual analytics with AI insights to create a clear, actionable summary of Tesla’s historical stock performance.

This project enhanced my skills in Python-based financial data analysis, AI-powered exploration, and visualization. It also reinforced how AI can augment data-driven decision-making in finance. Excited to take these insights into future machine learning and investment projects!
